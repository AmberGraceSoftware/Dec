Upon mount, all other children matching this name will be destroyed, and the template will be parented to nil by defalt. On unmount, it will be reparented to its original location if possible. Usage example: local function CardListUI() -- Define a VirtualInstance to be mounted on pre-existing UI in PlayerGui local rootUI = Dec.Premade() -- Index a ScrollingFrame containing template cards local cardList = rootUI:FindChild(&quot;ScrollingFrame&quot;) -- Extract the first template named &quot;CardTemplate&quot;, and destroy all other -- premade templates with that same name local cardTemplate = cardList:ExtractChildTemplate(&quot;CardTemplate&quot;) -- Generate 10 cards from the template local cards = {} for i = 1, 10 do table.insert(cards, Dec.Clone(cardTemplate, { LayoutOrder = i })) end return rootUI end   "},{"title":"FindChild​","type":1,"pageTitle":"VirtualInstance","url":"/api/VirtualInstance#FindChild","content":"&lt;/&gt; VirtualInstance:FindChild(childPath: string) → VirtualInstance Creates a new VirtualInstance that automatically mounts on the child of the parent VirtualInstance.
