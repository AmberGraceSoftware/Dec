# Introduction

:::caution
Dec is currently in early development, and a stable first release has not been
finished or tested. Stay tuned!
:::

Welcome to Dec! Dec enables you to write responsive UI for Roblox experiences
and plugins.

With Dec, you can write your UI applications entirely in code, or utilize
pre-made assets designed in Roblox Studio's UI editor.

## Why Dec?

Dec has many advantages over both standalone UI or other UI frameworks. Notably,
it:
- Makes it easy to rapidly prototype UI and adjust code when requirements change
- Makes it effortless to animate and write UI transitions to meet your vision
- Makes it easy to scale performant, complex menus and interactions to match
a project's needs
- Offers a robust repository of open source utilities that lend themselves
to well-understood code, with a detailed documentation to refer to at all times
as the only onboarding cost for new developers
- Offers first class support both for using pre-designed templates in Roblox
Studio, as well as writing components entirely in code depending on project
preferences and needs.
