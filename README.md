# Dec
Dec is a reactive UI library for Roblox.

It combines all of the best features of modern libraries like Roact, Fusion, and more for building reusable, performant, declarative UI components.

## Features

Dec is a **work in progress project** that started from a simple concept of ways to improve upon its predecessor, [Pract](https://github.com/AmberGraceRBLX/Pract), while using the most loved features of Elttob's [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion) with a cleaned up and much safer syntax for observables.

One of Dec's core features is its unique Virtual Instance reconciler, similar to [React's Virtual DOM](https://react.dev), which makes Dec a truly declarative UI framework while providing first class support and familiar syntax that you would expect from standalone Roblox UI development. Like Fusion, Dec does not enforce a distinct Component types and instead uses observables to reconcile components and instance properties only exactly when and where it is needed, leaeing to great performance gains over [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact). Dec also has first class support for object pooling, tweening, and more with a very simple and familiar syntax.
