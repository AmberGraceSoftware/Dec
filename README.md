Dec is a reactive UI library for Roblox.

It combines all of the best features of modern libraries like Roact, Fusion, and more for building reusable, performant, declarative UI components.

## Features

Dec is a **work in progress project** that started from a simple concept of ways to improve upon its predecessor, [Pract](https://github.com/AmberGraceRBLX/Pract), while using the most loved features of Elttob's [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion) with a cleaned up and much safer syntax for observables.

One of Dec's core features is its unique Virtual Instance reconciler, similar to [React's Virtual DOM](https://react.dev), which makes Dec a truly declarative UI framework while providing first class support and familiar syntax that you would expect from standalone Roblox UI development. Like Fusion, Dec uses observables to reconcile components and instance properties only exactly when and where it is needed, leading to great performance gains over [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact). Dec also has built-in support for object pooling, animation, and more with a very simple and familiar syntax.
